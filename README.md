**Agile Practices and Git Commit Guidelines**

**Agile Task Fields for Proper Planning**

1. **Task Name**: Clear, concise title.
2. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the task.
3. **Priority**: Level of importance (High, Medium, Low).
4. **Status**: Current state (To Do, In Progress, Done).
5. **Assignee**: Person responsible for the task.
6. **Story Points**: Effort estimation using points.
7. **Sprint**: Associated sprint or iteration.
8. **Due Date**: Deadline for completion.
9. **Labels/Tags**: Keywords for categorization.
10. **Dependencies**: Other tasks that need to be completed first.
11. **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that must be met for completion.
12. **Comments/Notes**: Space for additional information or updates.
13. **Attachments**: Relevant documents or files.

**Avoiding Spillover in Agile**

- **Prioritize Effectively**: Focus on high-priority tasks.
- **Refine Backlog**: Regularly groom and clarify tasks.
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Base sprint goals on team capacity.
- **Limit WIP**: Control concurrent work to avoid overload.
- **Improve Estimations**: Use historical data for accuracy.
- **Facilitate Communication**: Maintain open team communication.
- **Conduct Daily Stand-ups**: Monitor progress and adjust tasks.
- **Review and Adapt**: Use retrospectives to improve future sprints.

**Git Commit Best Practices for Frontend Developers**

- **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: E.g., “Fix button alignment on mobile view”.
- **Keep Commits Small and Focused**: Each commit for a single task or bug fix.
- **Branch Naming Conventions**: Use clear names like `feature/login-form`.
- **Commit Often**: Helps track progress and identify issues.
- **Use Conventional Commits**: Follow a format like `feat`, `fix`, `chore`.
- **Avoid Committing Build Files**: Exclude generated files.
- **Write Clear Code Comments**: Provide context for complex logic.
- **Link to Task or Issue**: Reference task IDs in commit messages.

**Git Commit Best Practices for Backend Developers**

- **Use Clear Commit Messages**: E.g., "Add caching to improve query performance".
- **Commit Small, Logical Units**: Manageable parts for each task or bug.
- **Consistent Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/user-authentication`.
- **Commit Often**: Easier tracking and debugging.
- **Follow Conventional Commits**: Use prefixes like `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`.
- **Exclude Sensitive Information**: No credentials in commits.
- **Reference Issues or Tasks**: Include task IDs for traceability.
- **Write Code Comments**: Document complex logic for better understanding.
- **Test Before Committing**: Ensure stability before committing changes.
- **Use Meaningful File Names**: Descriptive names reflecting purpose.

By following these guidelines, both frontend and backend developers can maintain a clean, efficient, and collaborative codebase.

**Git Commit and Agile Best Practices for Test Automation Engineers**

**Git Commit Best Practices**

1. **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Clearly describe changes, e.g., "Add test for login validation".
2. **Small, Atomic Commits**: Focus each commit on a single test case or fix.
3. **Consistent Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `test/add-login-tests`.
4. **Commit Often**: Regular commits help track progress and identify issues early.
5. **Follow Conventional Commits**: Use prefixes like `test`, `fix`, `chore`, e.g., `test: add end-to-end tests`.
6. **Exclude Logs and Temporary Files**: Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing unnecessary files.
7. **Link to Tasks or Issues**: Reference relevant task IDs or issue numbers in commit messages.

**Agile Best Practices**

1. **Define Clear Test Cases**: Ensure each test case has specific objectives and acceptance criteria.
2. **Prioritize Tests**: Focus on high-impact areas, such as critical paths and high-risk features.
3. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Automate tests to run with every build to catch issues early.
4. **Collaborate with Developers**: Work closely with developers to understand features and edge cases.
5. **Maintain Test Scripts**: Regularly update and refactor test scripts for readability and efficiency.
6. **Use Version Control**: Keep test scripts and data under version control to track changes and roll back if needed.
7. **Review and Retrospect**: Participate in sprint retrospectives to discuss test coverage and areas for improvement.

By following these guidelines, Test Automation Engineers can ensure high-quality testing and effective collaboration within an Agile framework.
